Western Ideals
===============

This is my spirtual sucessor to my previous pebble game, Forbidden Love.

This one has branching paths and somewhat better graphics.

It also has more interaction. Play the game to see what i mean C:

This game is best played on the Pebble time (codenamed "Basalt") but it is also playable

on the Pebble 1 and 2. (aka "Aplite" and "Diorite)

It is not properly playable on Chalk (Time Round) due to the unusual screen shape...

That could be fixed i suppose but i won't bother.


Enjoy the game

Oh, and it's made by me gameblabla obviously.
